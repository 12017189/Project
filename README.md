# Project

My file of tweets was too big to upload to Github (>100MB : ~25000 tweets), So I have included a dropbox link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/87b7zigso444ca8/twitter_data_2.txt?dl=0

If time and/or space is a concern, I am also including a smaller data set of around 5000 tweets:

Alternatively, GetTweets.py can be run from a terminal to collect tweets using Twitter's Streaming API:
$ python GetTweets.py > filename.txt
